# gsoc_arviz
To do:
Gen conversion requirements

Trace -> arviz functions
Use the trace object with the standard arviz functions

Convert mcmc chains in the form of trace to xarray datasets 

Adding groups to inference data- not necessary i think since we can directly add them in the trace which can then be converted
